üñºÔ∏è Image Caption Generator
In this project, I have developed an Image Caption Generator that combines deep learning-based image feature extractors with sequence models to generate accurate and meaningful captions for images.

The model architecture is composed of two main components:

üß† Feature Extraction Head: Utilizes various state-of-the-art deep learning models (e.g., VGG16, InceptionV3, ResNet) to extract rich visual features from input images.

‚úçÔ∏è Caption Generation Module: Implements multiple sequence models (such as LSTMs, GRUs, and Transformers) to convert the extracted features into coherent textual descriptions.

I experimented with several combinations of feature extractors and sequence models to determine the best-performing architecture in terms of caption quality and accuracy.
